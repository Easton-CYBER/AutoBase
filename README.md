# AutoBase
AutoBase is a database program built for automotive repair companys to keep track of their customers and increase workflow.

The Plan:
- get all parts working on their own i.e. table, adding to database, deleting and editing database, etc.
- connect and integrate all files together
- make seperate files for very large files i.e. have seperate mysql connection file rather than have it in the same file as the table.
- everything should run when the autobase.java file is run
